# Makana — Tone & Voice Guidelines

This document defines how Makana speaks.

Makana is a **practice medium** built around intentional strength, alignment, and restraint.  
The tone must reflect mastery without ego, confidence without pressure, and care without sentimentality.

Tone is not decoration.  
Tone is part of the system.

---

## 1. Core Tone Principles

Makana’s voice should always be:

- Calm
- Grounded
- Direct
- Respectful
- Non-judgmental

Makana never:
- pressures
- shames
- performs motivation
- explains too much
- talks down to the user

If the tone feels loud, clever, or salesy, it is wrong.

---

## 2. The Role of Language in Makana

Language in Makana exists to:
- reduce friction
- clarify next steps
- support alignment
- protect energy

Language does **not** exist to:
- hype outcomes
- dramatize effort
- narrate productivity
- create urgency

Words should feel like **guidance**, not commentary.

---

## 3. Sentence Style

### Preferred
- Short sentences
- Clear statements
- Active voice
- Plain language

Examples:
- “Begin when ready.”
- “That’s enough for now.”
- “Save the next step.”

### Avoid
- Long explanations
- Metaphors in UI text
- Emojis in core interactions
- Exclamation points

If a sentence can be shorter, shorten it.

---

## 4. Emotional Posture

Makana assumes the user is:
- capable
- thoughtful
- doing their best

Makana never assumes:
- laziness
- lack of discipline
- failure
- deficiency

The system does not correct people.  
It **adjusts conditions**.

---

## 5. Encouragement (When Used)

Encouragement is allowed, but restrained.

Encouragement should:
- acknowledge effort
- recognize form
- affirm alignment

Encouragement should not:
- inflate ego
- exaggerate impact
- push for more

### Good examples
- “Clean start.”
- “Good stopping point.”
- “Alignment restored.”

### Bad examples
- “You’re crushing it!”
- “Keep grinding!”
- “One more push!”

Makana supports continuity, not intensity.

---

## 6. Silence as a Feature

Makana does not need to speak at every moment.

Silence is appropriate when:
- the user is focused
- no adjustment is needed
- an action completed cleanly

Over-communication is noise.  
Silence is respect.

---

## 7. Clutch-Specific Tone

Clutch speaks only when necessary.

Clutch language should feel:
- mechanical
- neutral
- precise
- calm

Examples:
- “Aligning.”
- “Reducing force.”
- “Holding steady.”
- “Released.”

Clutch never:
- jokes
- reassures emotionally
- explains itself

Clutch communicates state, not opinion.

---

## 8. Error & Edge States

Errors are treated as neutral conditions.

### Good
- “Unable to start right now.”
- “Let’s pause here.”
- “Try again later.”

### Avoid
- “Something went wrong!”
- “Oops!”
- “You missed this.”

No blame.  
No urgency.  
Just information.

---

## 9. Onboarding Tone

Onboarding should feel:
- optional
- respectful
- lightweight

Rules:
- Questions are skippable
- Language is invitational, not required
- No “setup checklist” pressure

Examples:
- “If you’d like, you can adjust this later.”
- “You can skip this.”

Makana never traps users in onboarding.

---

## 10. Documentation Tone

Documentation should be:
- clear
- honest
- concise
- non-defensive

Avoid:
- marketing language
- exaggerated claims
- over-explaining philosophy

Documentation exists to help people build and understand, not to persuade.

---

## 11. Humor

Humor is rare and subtle.

Allowed:
- dry
- situational
- understated

Not allowed:
- sarcasm
- jokes about productivity
- humor that distracts from use

If humor draws attention to itself, remove it.

---

## 12. Words & Phrases to Prefer

- practice
- alignment
- adjust
- continue
- pause
- enough
- steady
- return

---

## 13. Words & Phrases to Avoid

- hustle
- grind
- optimize
- maximize
- crush
- win
- failure
- productivity

Makana is not a performance coach.

---

## 14. Tone Checklist (Before Shipping Copy)

Ask:
- Is this calm?
- Is this respectful?
- Is this necessary?
- Can this be shorter?
- Can this be silent instead?

If unsure, remove or simplify.

---

## Closing

Makana’s tone should feel like:

- a skilled instructor
- a steady hand
- a quiet presence

If the voice ever tries to motivate, impress, or persuade, it has failed.

The tone is part of the practice.
