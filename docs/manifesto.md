# The Makana Manifesto

Makana exists because most tools demand too much from people.

They assume endless energy.  
They punish inconsistency.  
They confuse pressure with progress.

We reject that.

## We believe

Living well is not about doing more.  
It is about doing what fits.

Strength is not constant output.  
Strength is knowing when to begin, when to stop, and when to adjust.

Continuity matters more than intensity.  
Alignment matters more than speed.

---

## We reject grind culture

We do not believe in:
- streaks that punish rest
- systems that shame inconsistency
- tools that confuse exhaustion with discipline
- optimization that ignores the body and mind

Burnout is not failure.  
It is a signal that force replaced alignment.

---

## We treat life as practice

Life is not a performance.  
It is a practice.

Practice includes:
- imperfect starts
- early stops
- quiet days
- low-capacity weeks
- returning again without guilt

Progress is not linear.  
Practice does not require applause.

---

## We design for real conditions

People are:
- tired
- busy
- caring for others
- uncertain
- healing
- learning

Makana is built for these conditions.

Not for ideal weeks.  
Not for peak performance fantasies.

---

## We respect energy

Energy is finite.  
Attention is precious.

Makana:
- reduces noise
- limits force
- allows silence
- disengages early to prevent damage

If a system costs more energy than it returns, it is wrong.

---

## We do not fix people

People are not broken.

Makana does not correct behavior or impose discipline.
It adjusts conditions so people can act with clarity.

The user is capable.
The system exists to support them, not replace them.

Makana respects people.
That respect is the practice.

---

## We choose restraint

More features are not better features.
More data is not better insight.
More engagement is not better design.

We choose:
- simplicity over novelty
- durability over excitement
- trust over persuasion

---

## We build with care

Makana will:
- stay calm
- stay optional
- stay respectful
- stay on the user’s side

If a decision trades dignity for growth, we will not take it.

---

## This is the work

Makana is not here to motivate.
It is here to hold space for practice.

Quietly.
Consistently.
Over time.

That is enough.
