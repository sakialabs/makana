# 🥋 Makana

> Makana is a **practice medium for developing intentional strength** by starting, stopping, and shaping life with care, alignment, and respect for energy.

The name *Makana* comes from Sudanese slang, referring to a person who is **strong, intelligent, and formidable**.

In Arabic, *makana* can also mean machine, often said of someone exceptionally capable.

It echoes the literal meaning of *Kung Fu*: mastery cultivated through practice over time.

## 🧭 The idea

Makana is not a productivity framework, habit tracker, or doctrine.

It is a **practice medium**.

Like clay.  
Like an instrument.  
Like martial arts forms.

Makana provides structure, timing, and gentle constraints so people can practice living in a way that fits their **energy, values, and season**.

The user is the practitioner.  
Makana provides the medium.

---

## ✨ What Makana helps with

Makana focuses on fundamentals that matter in real life:

- Starting when it's hard to start  
- Stopping cleanly, without guilt or crashing  
- Protecting energy over time  
- Adjusting force instead of forcing consistency  

These are not hacks.  
They are skills.  
They compound.

---

## 🌊 Core flow

Makana is intentionally minimal.

- **Daily Check**  
  A short check-in and one task for tomorrow

- **Ignition**  
  Begin a short session (default 25 minutes). Bad starts count.

- **Braking**  
  Save the next tiny step. Stop clean.

- **Reduced Mode**  
  Focus narrows by design. One meaningful action is enough.

- **Weekly Check**  
  Scope adjusts based on energy and stress

Minimal by design.  
Foundational by intent.

---

## 🧲 Clutch (alignment & pull)

**Clutch is Makana's alignment layer.**

Clutch represents attraction, alignment, and gentle pull toward what matters.

It:
- Nudges gently  
- Speaks in short lines  
- Respects silence  
- Protects energy  

Mechanically, Clutch:
- Engages smoothly  
- Limits force when needed  
- Disengages early to prevent damage  

Clutch preserves momentum instead of extracting output.

---

## 🧩 Setups (modular ways of practicing)

Makana is modular by design.

A **Setup** is a temporary way of holding life.  
Not identity.  
Not goals.  
Not habits.

Setups define constraints, defaults, and tone.

Examples:
- **The Calm Setup**  
- **Reduced Setup**  
- **Vitality Setup**
- **Alignment Setup**  
- **Studio Setup**  
- **Presence Setup**

People move between setups as life changes.

Makana adapts to people.  
People do not adapt to Makana.

---

## 🌿 Vitality & healthspan 

Makana treats health as **part of living**, not a separate grind.

The Vitality Setup:
- Installs once  
- Runs quietly  
- Learns by asking, not assuming  
- Respects culture, belief, and preference  
- Surfaces one insight at most  
- Offers one gentle suggestion, if needed  

What it avoids:
- Guilt  
- Grind culture  
- Medical claims  
- Over-optimization  
- Anxiety dashboards  

More life feels good.  
Makana helps protect that.

---

## 🕹️ Gamification (practice & mastery)

Makana gamifies **practice and mastery**, not addiction.

It does not use:
- Streaks  
- Leaderboards  
- Pressure loops  
- Shame resets  

Instead, Makana recognizes **form**, quietly.

Examples of practiced forms:
- Clean Start  
- Clean Stop  
- Gentle Recovery  
- Return to Alignment  
- Continuity Through Low Weeks  

Progress is felt, not shouted.

## 💰 Monetization philosophy

**Makana is free at the core.  
People pay to deepen, not to unlock dignity.**

Always free:
- Core flow  
- Reduced Mode  
- Core Clutch behavior  
- Daily use  

Optional paid layers (later):
- Multiple custom setups  
- Advanced Clutch tuning  
- Gentle history views (patterns, not pressure)  
- Export and backup  
- Optional AI language enhancement (opt-in)  

Never:
- Ads  
- Selling data  
- Guilt-based upsells  
- Locking survival behind paywalls  

Makana stays on the user's side.

---

## 🤖 AI & privacy

Makana does not require large language models to work.

- **v1:** deterministic rules and heuristics  
- **Future:** optional, opt-in AI augmentation  
- No raw personal data sent by default  
- Users choose if and how AI is used  

Predictability and trust come first.

---

## 🛠️ Tech stack

- **Web:** Next.js (TypeScript)  
- **Mobile:** Expo (React Native + TypeScript)  
- **Backend:** Python + FastAPI  
- **Database/Auth:** Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS)  

One engine.  
Multiple expressions.
